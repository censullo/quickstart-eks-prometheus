This guide provides instructions for deploying the Prometheus Quick Start into Amazon EKS.

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that records metrics in a time-series database. Prometheus features a multi-dimensional data model, defining metrics by name and a set of key/value pairs. Metrics are collected from targets discovered through service directory or a static configuration using a pull model over HTTP. Time-series pushing is supported from short-lived jobs to intermediary ones that can be scraped by Prometheus. The user can choose and aggregate time-series data with the custom Prometheus query language PromQL. Prometheus features an expression browser for viewing expression results, and offers multiple modes of graphing and dashboard support including Grafana.

In addition to deploying Prometheus into Amazon EKS, this Quick Start also configures monitoring for EKS nodes (`node-exporter`) and the Kubernetes API server (`kube-state-metrics`).

This Quick Start is for developers, DevOps, security teams, and any role within an organization that deploys and maintains applications on Amazon EKS.
