This guide provides instructions for deploying the Prometheus Quick Start into Amazon EKS.

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, providing a reliable, multidimensional time-series data store. Prometheus's main features are the following:

* A multidimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key-value pairs.
* PromQL, a flexible query language.
* No reliance on distributed storage; single-server nodes are autonomous.
* Time-series collection using a pull model over HTTP.
* Pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway.
* Targets are discovered using service discovery or a static configuration.
* Multiple modes of graphing and dashboard support.

In addition to deploying Prometheus into Amazon EKS, this Quick Start also configures monitoring for EKS nodes (`node-exporter`) and the Kubernetes API server (`kube-state-metrics`).

This Quick Start is for developers, DevOps, security teams, and any role within an organization that deploys and maintains applications on Amazon EKS.
