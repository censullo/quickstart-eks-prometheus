* Pushgateway deployment with a pod to push metrics from short-lived jobs to intermediary jobs that Prometheus can scrape.
* Kube-state-metrics DaemonSet with a pod to monitor the Kubernetes API server.
* Server StatefulSet with a pod and attached persistent volume (PV) to scrap and store time-series data. The pod uses persistent volume claims (PVCs) to request PV resources.
* Alertmanager StatefulSet with a pod and attached PV for deduplication, grouping, and routing of alerts.
* Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage volume.
