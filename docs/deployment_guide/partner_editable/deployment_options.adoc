// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* https://fwd.aws/EKAg7?[Deploy into a new VPC and new Amazon EKS cluster.^] This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, EKS cluster, a node group, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys Prometheus into this new EKS cluster.

* https://fwd.aws/9DYrk?[Deploy into a new Amazon EKS cluster in an existing VPC.^] This option builds a new Amazon EKS cluster, node group, and other infrastructure components into an existing VPC. It then deploys Prometheus into this new EKS cluster.

* https://fwd.aws/a3pkr?[Deploy into an existing Amazon EKS cluster.^] This option provisions Prometheus in your existing AWS infrastructure. Note that when deploying into an EKS cluster that was not created by the Amazon EKS on the AWS Cloud Quick Start, you must prepare the cluster as described in the Deployment steps section.

This Partner Solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
